# Mastermind

the computer makes a code, you can guess, and it reponds with how well you did

...

the goal here is to write a game I enjoyed playing as a kid three ways:

1) single player (against the browser), fundamental React (this.state)

2) single player (against the server), network tahini + this.props.subState

3) multiplayer over socket / dynamo / lambda / rtc / pigeon ( w social login )


it'll take a few months, so who cares!
